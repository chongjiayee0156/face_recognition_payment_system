# Face Payment System

This project implements a face recognition-based payment confirmation system using Python. The system uses a webcam to capture video feed, detects and recognizes faces, and allows users to confirm payments if they are recognized.

## Features

- Real-time face detection and recognition using OpenCV and the `face_recognition` library.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.
- Integration with a payment confirmation function.
- JSON-based user data management.
